(2) Examples of:
    (a) Arithmetic operators
        (i) let x = 5;
            let y = 10;
            console.log(x + y);

        (ii) let x = 5;
             let y = 10;
             console.log(x - y);

    (b) Assignment operators
         (i) let x = 5;
             x++;

        (ii) let x = 5;
             x += 10;

    (c) Comparison operators
        (i) let x = 5;
            console.log(x < 1);

        (ii) let x = 5;
             console.log(x > 1);

    (d) Equality operators
        (i) let x = 5;
            let y = '5';
            console.log(x == y);

        (ii) let x = 5;
             let y = '5';
             console.log(x === y);

    (e) Ternary operators
        (i) let x = 10;
            let y = (x > 5) ? console.log('x is greater than 10') : console.log('x is less than 10');

    (f) Logical operators
        (i) let Nationality = 'Nigerian';
            let Age = 18;
            if (Nationality === Nigerian && Age >= 18){
                console.log('Eligible to vote');
            }
            else{
                console.log('Not eligible to vote');
            };
