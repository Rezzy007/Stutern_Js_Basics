(6) In my understanding, statically typed programming languages perform type checking at compile time.
This means that any error detected during compilation of the program must be fixed before the program can be compliled. Also, statically typed programming languages require you to declare the data type before it can be used. for example, in C programming language the data type of a variable is first declared as follows before assigning a value to it:

        Int i;
        i = 5

    Examples of statically typed programming languages are Java, C, C++

    On the other hand, dynamically typed programming languages perform type checking at runtime. This means that the program can still be compiled even though there are errors. Dynamically typed programming languages do not require one to declare a data type of a variable before assigning a value. The data type is usually detected based on the value assigned to the variable. For example, in Python, we can simply say:

        i = 5

    Here, Python automatically knows that the value '5' assigned to the variable 'i' is an integer without first declaring the data type.
    Examples of dynamically typed programming languages are Python, Javascript, PHP

(7) Undefined is a type while null is an object. If a variables is 'undefined' it means the variable was
    declared but no value was assigned to it.
    Null can be assigned as a value to a variable which means the variable is empty.
